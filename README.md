## Introduction
👨‍💻 I am Kshitij Roodkee, a tech enthusiast and a final-year student at the National Institute of Technology Hamirpur 🎓. 🏔️ I hail from the land of mountains and valleys, Himachal Pradesh, and love exploring the beauty of nature 🌄. 
💻 As a computer science and engineering student, I'm passionate about bringing animations and graphics to life 🎨, especially when it comes to coding 3D worlds 🌎. 
I volunteer for the content creation and web design club PIXONOIDS and the computer science department's club, Team.EXE 🤝. 
🌿 When not coding or volunteering, you can find me wandering in the breathtaking landscape of my hometown, seeking inspiration from the tranquil surroundings 🌳. 
🌟 I'm excited to learn and do internships🚀!
